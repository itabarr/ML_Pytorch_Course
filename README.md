# ML_Pytorch_Course

Welcome to my private repository for a machine learning course using PyTorch. This course is inspired by this [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIsg-ZUy0MY&t=3864s). Most content in this repository revolves around the projects presented in the course.

## Topics Covered:

1. **PyTorch Basics**: Tensors & Gradients
2. **Linear Regression & Gradient Descent**
3. **Image Classification using Logistic Regression**
4. **Training Deep Neural Networks on a GPU**
5. **Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks**
6. **Data Augmentation, Regularization, and ResNets**
7. **Generating Images using Generative Adversarial Networks**

Each topic has its dedicated Python script(s). Shared code can be found in the `utils.py` file. Apart from tasks and projects from the course, I have added modifications and enhancements such as visualization, data exploration, and more.

I'll make sure to have meaningful commit messages to provide insights into my thought process.

## Environment:

- **OS**: Windows 11
- **Python Version**: 3.8.7
- **PyTorch Version**: 2.0.1+cu118

## Getting Started:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up a virtual environment.
3. Install dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file. (Note: If PyTorch is not natively supported, refer to the PyTorch official website for installation guidance.)
4. Run any Python file related to a topic as an entry point (no command-line arguments required).
